    "|This program requires the use of **`print`** output and use of  **`input`**, **`for`**/**`in`** loop, **`if`**, file **`open`**, **`.readline`**, **`.append`**, **`.strip`**, **`len`**. and function **`def`** and **`return`**. The code should also consider using most of the following (`.upper()` or `.lower()`, `.title()`, `print(\"hello\",end=\"\")` `else`, `elif`, `range()`, `while`, `.close()`). You must include your full name in the initial prompt. See the sample input and output for more detail. |\n",
